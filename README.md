# mythicpl.us
A simple flat file site designed to load quickly and give m+ information at a glance (and in multiple languages thanks to some great contributors!).

Huge thank yous to everyone that provided feedback via reddit, github, discord, whatever. 
It doesn't mean I hate you if I didn't mention you, I probably just forgot. Thank you to everyone who has kept this site afloat.

## Contributing
Fork the page and submit a pull request with your changes.  

It should be noted that you'll have to change the page to use the local static Javascript and CSS as it is set up currently to be fed through a server-side minifier in production.  

Find the style tag that has `?f=assets/css/style.css` and change it to `assets/css/style.css`. Also change the `?g=js` and create individual `<script>` tags for all the scripts in `assets/js`.
